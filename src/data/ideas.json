We've come to call this mechanism simply as `Procrastination`. Recognize that you are not lazy. Instead, consider how a boring chore can be made more fun, an overwhelming project can be split in smaller tasks and everything you've learned up to this point once felt just as out of reach as the solutions that escape you now",
    "The hardest part of any endeavour is getting started. Do not overwhelm yourself with the idea that you must engage in a new project for hours each day, come rain or shine. Instead, begin with 15-30 minutes and add 5-15 minutes each day on top of it. Just like with muscles, a brain needs to be given time to get used to the new work-load",

Whether lifting weights in a gym, doing calisthenics or simply going for a brisk walk, we have collectively agreed to put ourselves back into shape.

Calisthenics for the brain. Spend more time with the smartphone in the other room. Engage with your own thoughts more often. Read and learn new things regularly. The best part? A brisk daily walk with benefit both the body and the brain"
